  Elements:
    "Native elements are those chemical elements that occur in nature uncombined with other elements. They are commonly divided into three groups: metals (copper, platinum, iron, gold, and silver); semimetals (arsenic); and nonmetals (sulphur and carbon). Other native elements that occur more rarely are cadmium, mercury, nickel, chromium, tin, iridium, palladium, osmium, antimony, bismuth, tellurium, and selenium. These mostly occur in minute amounts, often alloyed with other native elements. The native from under greatly contrasting physical and chemical conditions and in a variety of rock types.",
  Sulfides:
    "Sulfides are minerals in which sulfur (a nonmetal) is combined either with a metal or a semimetal. Some sulfides are brilliantly colored, and most of them have low hardness and high specific gravity. Sulfides are common and are found widely in nature. Most sulfides have simple atomic structures, in which sulfur atoms are stacked alternately with metal or semimetal atoms and arranged as cubes, octahedra, or tetrahedra. This yields highly symmetrical crystal forms. Except in a few sulfides, such as orpiment and realgar, the symmetrical form also gives rise tomany of the properties also found in metals, including metallic luster and electrical conductivity. ",
  Halides:
    "Minerals in this group consist of metals combined with one of the four common halogen elements: fluorine, chlorine, iodine, or bromine. Halides tend to be soft and many crystallize in the cubic system.Compositionally and structurally, there are three broad categories of halide mineral: simple halides, halide complexes, and oxyhydroxy-halides. Simple halides form when a metal combines with a halogen. Halite and fluorite are examples of simple halides. In halide complexes, the halide is usually bound to aluminum, creating a molecule that behaves as a single unit, which is in turn bound to a metal. For example, in cryolite, fluorine and aluminum are bound to sodium. Oxyhydroxy-halides are very rare. Atacamite is an example of these halides.",
  Oxides:
    "The minerals in this group have crystal structures in which metals or semimetals occupy spaces between oxygen atoms. The properties of oxides vary: the metallic ores and gemstone varieties tend to be hard and have a high specific gravity.Oxides can be either simple or multiple. Simple oxides, such as cuprite (Cu2O), contain only one metal or semimetal and oxygen. Multiple oxides have two different metal sites, both of which may be occupied by several different metals or semimetals. The minerals in the spinel group are examples of multiple oxides.",
  Carbonates:
    "There are approximately 80 known carbonate minerals. Most of them are rare, but the common carbonates calcite and dolomite are major rock-forming minerals. Carbonates form rhombohedral crystals and are soft, soluble in hydrochloric acid, and often vividly coloured. All carbonates contain the carbonate group as the basic compositional and structural unit. This group has a carbon atom in the center of an equilateral triangle of oxygen atoms, giving rise to the trigonal symmetry of many carbonate minerals. This basic unit is joined by one or more metals or semimetals such as calcium, sodium, aluminium,manganese, barium, zinc, and copper.",
  Borates:
    "Borate minerals are compounds containing boron and oxygen. Most borate minerals are rare, but a few, such as borax, ulexite, colemanite, and kernite, form large, commercially mined deposits. Borates tend to be soft and either white or colourless. Structurally, boron and oxygen may form a triangle or a tetrahedron, each with a boron atom. These structures act as a single chemical unit that bonds to a metal, such as sodium in borax and calcium in colemanite. Borates tend to contain water molecules or a hydroxyl (OH) group, which acts as a chemical unit bonded into their structure. Some borates contain both.",
  Sulfates:
    "Sulphates, molybdates, chromates, and tungstates share similar structures and chemical behaviour. Sulfates are soft and lightweight, chromates are rare and brightly coloured, and tungstates and molybdates are dense, hard, brittle, and vividly coloured.Sulfate minerals have a tetrahedral crystal structure, with four oxygen atoms at each corner and a sulphur atom in the centre. The sulphate tetrahedron behaves chemically as a single, negatively charged radical or unit. All sulphates contain an SO4 group. The basic structural unit of the chromates, molybdates, and tungstates is also a tetrahedron formed from four oxygen atoms, with a central chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), or tungsten (W) atom, respectively.",
  Phosphates:
    "The phosphate, arsenate, and vanadate minerals are grouped together because their crystal structures are similar. The phosphates are the most numerous of the three groups, with more than 200 known minerals. Phosphates contain phosphorus and oxygen in a 1:4 ratio. The combined atoms act as a single unit that in turn combines with other elements to form phosphate minerals. Arsenates have a basic structural unit of arsenic and oxygen, written as AsO4, which combines with other elements to form arsenate minerals. Most arsenates are rare and many are brilliantly coloured. Vanadates mostly contain the same type of structural tetrahedra as the phosphates and arsenates. The structures of vanadates are complex, and these minerals are relatively rare. ",
  Silicates:
    "The silicates constitute around 25 percent of all known minerals and nearly half of the most common ones. All silicates are built around a basic structure of silicon and oxygen. They are a major component of Earth and occur in lunar samples and meteorites.The silicates make up about 95 percent of the crust and upper mantle of Earth. All silicates contain silicon and oxygen. Silicon is a lightweight, shiny metal; oxygen is a colourless gas. In silicates, silicon and oxygen combine to form structural tetrahedra, each with a silicon atom in the centre and oxygen atoms at the corners. Silicates are divided into six main groups according to the structural configurations that result from the different ways in which tetrahedra and other elements are linked. Within these main groups are further subdivisions based on chemistry.  ",
  Organic:
    "Generated by organic (biological) processes, the organics may or may not be crystalline. In some cases, they contain the same mineral matter—such as calcite or aragonite—as that generated through inorganic processes. Organics are sometimes used as gems.The organics have a highly varied composition. Coral, pearl, and shell contain mineral matter generated by biological processes. Amber is fossilized resin, mainly from extinct coniferous trees, although amberlike substances from even older trees are also known. Copal is a modern equivalent of fossilized amber. Coal is derived from buried organic material, such as peat. Bitumen is a very heavy oil.",
